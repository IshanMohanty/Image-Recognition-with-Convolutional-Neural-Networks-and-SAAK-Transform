# Image-Recognition-with-Convolutional-Neural-Networks-and-SAAK-Transform


Implemented and Trained a CNN derived from the Lenet-5 architecture on the MNIST dataset and analysed different parameter settings to achieve the best performance of the model. Trained the SAAK Transform using available codebase (https://github.com/davidsonic/Saak-Transform) on the MNIST dataset and then compared its performance with the CNN model.
