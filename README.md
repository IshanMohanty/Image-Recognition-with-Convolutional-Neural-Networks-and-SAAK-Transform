# Image-Recognition-with-Convolutional-Neural-Networks-and-SAAK-Transform
Trained a CNN derived from the Lenet-5 architecture on the MNIST dataset and analysed different parameter settings to achieve the best performance of the model. Trained the SAAK Transform on the MNIST dataset and then compared its performance with the CNN model.
